    "An interesting use-case of a linked list is to track edits in a \"Undo - Redo\" interface. Thus far we have really only talked about connecting singular data points in the nodes. The following task will deviate from that:\n",
    "I want you to create an interface of an application that will alter the contents of a list. As you alter the contents of the list, you should be able to retrieve the previous state of the list as you change it, much like being able to undo and redo changes in a document. Your application interface should support three basic functions, undo(), redo(), and do() where \"do()\" is what actually alters the contents of the list. You can interpret \"do()\" as what happens when you type in a word processor. I want you to \"do()\" the following actions:\n",
    "* Create a list with the initial values of: [5,3,2,1,4,8] \n",
    "* Sort the list.\n",
    "* Reverse the list\n",
    "* Add a 9 to the end of the list.\n",
    "* Undo back to before you reversed the list. \n",
    "* Add a 9 to the end of the list again\n",
    "* Undo back to the original state of the list.\n",
    "* After every operation, print the current state of the \"application\", remember that your application's only functionality is to change the state of the list.\n",

    "A remote printing system serving a large pool of individuals can be very complicated to support. In theory, a simple queue that takes in print requests and dequeue's them once they have been processed would serve all the required operations. However, there are significant problems that arise as far as user requests and other things. What are some of the issues that you can see with a simple queue that only supports First In First Out operations typical of a queue? (Enqueue, dequeue, peek, etc.) For your submission, you can either submit a second video of 1-2 minutes in length, or small report of approximately 1 page that discusses the various shortcomings of a queue to support a remote printer system."
